<concept id="library-versus-framework"><title id="x-1">Library versus Framework</title><conbody id="x-2"><p id="libframe1">I'm going to be a bit bold and say the defining line between a library and a framework is that a framework tells you how to lay out your code into a file/folder structure. You may not agree with this definition, but it's useful to explain how this book will begin.</p><p id="libframe2">The Yesod Web Framework comes with a tool that automatically generates a full site
            template with a bunch of bells and whistles, known as the scaffolder. This is the
            recommended way to get started on a new Yesod application. This added convenience,
            however, hides away some of the important details going on behind the scenes.</p><p id="libframe3">So to start off, we're going to be treating Yesod as a library. Having to explicitly write all the code is a good exercise to get started. <xref id="x1" href="../scaffolding-and-the-site-template/scaffolding-and-the-site-template.dita">Later on</xref>, we'll introduce the scaffolding tool and describe the standard layout of a Yesod project.</p></conbody></concept>
