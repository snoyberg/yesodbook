        <p id="x-3">The final piece in the puzzle is the Enumeratee. This is a combination of an Iteratee (it
            consumes some data) and an Enumerator (is passes it other data on). It can be thought of
            as a <i id="x-4">stream transformer</i>, or as a pipe connecting an Enumerator to an
            Iteratee.</p>
