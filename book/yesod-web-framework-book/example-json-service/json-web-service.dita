  <p id="x1">Let's create a very simple web service: it takes a JSON request and returns a JSON
            response. We're going to write the server in WAI/Warp, and the client in <apiname
                id="x-3">http-conduit</apiname>. We'll be using <apiname id="x2">aeson</apiname> for
            JSON parsing and rendering. We could also write the server in Yesod itself, but for such
            a simple example, the extra features of Yesod don't add much.</p>
