  <p id="x1">"But wait a minute," you say. "You said the synopsis uses applicative forms, but I'm
   sure the type signature said <codeph id="x-3">MForm</codeph>. Shouldn't it be Monadic?" That's true, the
   final form we produced was monadic. But what really happened is that we converted an applicative
   form to a monadic one.</p>
  <p id="x2">Again, our goal is to reuse code as much as possible, and minimize the number of
   functions in the API. And Monadic forms are more powerful than Applicative, if more clumsy, so
   anything that can be expressed in an Applicative form could also be expressed in a Monadic form.
   There are two core functions that help out with this: <codeph id="x-4">aformToForm</codeph> converts any
   applicative form to a monadic one, and <codeph id="x-5">formToAForm</codeph> converts certain kinds of
   monadic forms to applicative forms.</p>
  <p id="x3">"But wait <b id="x4">another</b> minute," you insist. "I didn't see any
    <codeph id="x-6">aformToForm</codeph>!" Also true. The <codeph id="x-7">renderDivs</codeph> function takes care of
   that for us.</p>
