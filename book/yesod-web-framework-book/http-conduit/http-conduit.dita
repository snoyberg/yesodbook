 <title>http-conduit</title>
 <conbody>
  <p>Most of Yesod is about serving content over HTTP. But that's only half the story: someone has
   to receive it. And even when you're writing a web app, sometimes that someone will be you. If you
   want to consume content from other services or interact with RESTful APIs, you'll need to write
   client code. And the recommended approach for that is <apiname>http-conduit</apiname>.</p>
  <p>This chapter is not directly connected to Yesod, and will be generally useful for anyone
   wanting to make HTTP requests.</p>
