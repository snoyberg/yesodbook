<concept id="performance"><title id="x-1">Performance</title><conbody id="x-2"><p id="p1">Haskell's main compiler, the GHC, has amazing performance characteristics, and is improving all the time. This choice of language by itself gives Yesod a large performance advantage over other offerings. But that's not enough: we need an architecture designed for performance.</p><p id="p2">Our approach to templates is one example: by allowing HTML, CSS and JavaScript to be
            analyzed at compile time, Yesod both avoids costly disk I/O at runtime and can optimize
            the rendering of this code. But the architectural decisions go deeper: we use advanced
            techniques such as conduits and builders in the underlying libraries to make sure our
            code runs in constant memory, without exhausting precious file handles and other
            resources. By offering high-level abstractions, you can get highly compressed and
            properly cached CSS and JavaScript.</p><p id="p3">Yesod's flagship web server, Warp, is the fastest Haskell web server around. When these two pieces of technology are combined, it produces one of the fastest web application deployment solutions available.</p></conbody></concept>
