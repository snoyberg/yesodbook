Some of them simply affect the transfer of data between the server and client, and should not affect the application at all. For example, Accept-Encoding informs the server which compression schemes the client understands, and Host informs the server which virtual host to serve up.</p><p id="rh2">Other headers <i id="x1">do</i> affect the application, but are automatically read by Yesod. For example, the Accept-Language header specifies which human language (English, Spanish, German, Swiss-German) the client prefers. See the <xref id="x2" href="../internationalization/internationalization.dita">i18n chapter</xref> for details on how this header is used.</p></conbody></concept>
