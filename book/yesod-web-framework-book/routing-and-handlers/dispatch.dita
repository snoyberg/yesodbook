            of dispatch for you. You just need to make sure to provide the appropriate <term id="x1"
                >handler functions</term>. For subsite routes, you do not need to write any handler
            functions, but you do for the other two. We mentioned the naming rules above
                (<codeph>MyHandlerR GET</codeph> becomes <codeph>getMyHandlerR</codeph>,
                <codeph>MyOtherHandlerR</codeph> becomes <codeph>handleMyOtherHandlerR</codeph>).
            Now we need the type signature.</p></conbody></concept>
