<concept id="request-information"><title id="x-1">Request Information</title><conbody id="x-2"><p id="ghandler4">The most common information you will want to get about the current request is the
            requested path, the query string parameters and POSTed form data. The first of those is
            dealt with in the routing, as described above. The other two are best dealt with using
            the <xref id="x-3" href="../forms-09/forms.dita#forms" format="dita">forms module</xref>.</p><p id="ghandler5">That said, you will sometimes need to get the data in a more raw format. For this purpose, Yesod exposes the <codeph id="x2">Request</codeph> datatype along with the <codeph id="x3">getRequest</codeph> function to retrieve it. This gives you access to the full list of GET parameters, cookies, and preferred languages. There are some convenient functions to make these lookups easier, such as <codeph id="x4">lookupGetParam</codeph>, <codeph id="x5">lookupCookie</codeph> and <codeph id="x6">languages</codeph>. For raw access to the POST parameters, you should use <codeph id="x7">runRequest</codeph>.</p><p id="ghandler6">If you need even more raw data, like request headers, you can use <codeph id="x8">waiRequest</codeph> to access the <xref id="x9" href="../../yesod-web-framework-book/web-application-interface/web-application-interface.dita">WAI</xref> request value.</p></conbody></concept>
