        <p id="x-3">Sessions are the number one way we bypass the statelessness imposed by HTTP. We
            shouldn't consider this an escape hatch to perform whatever actions we want:
            statelessness in web applications is a virtue, and we should respect it whenever
            possible. However, there are specific cases where it is vital to retain some state.</p><p id="s1">The session API in Yesod is very simple. It provides a key-value store, and a few
            convenience functions built on top for common use cases. If used properly, with small
            payloads, sessions should be an unobtrusive part of your web development.</p></conbody></concept>
