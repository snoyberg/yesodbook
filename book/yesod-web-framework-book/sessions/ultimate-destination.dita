                id="x1">yesod-auth</apiname>. Let's say a user requests a page that requires
            authentication. Clearly, you need to send them to the login page. A well-designed web
            app will then <i id="x2">send them back to the first page they requested</i>. That's
            what we call the ultimate destination.</p><p id="u2"><codeph id="x3">redirectUltDest</codeph> sends the user to the ultimate
            destination set in his/her session, clearing that value from the
            session. It takes a default destination as well, in case there is
            no destination set. For setting the session, there are three
            variants: <codeph id="x4">setUltDest</codeph> sets the destination to the given
            type-safe URL, <codeph id="x5">setUltDestString</codeph> does the same with a
            text URL, and <codeph id="x6">setUltDest'</codeph> sets the destination to the
            currently requested URL.</p></conbody></concept>
