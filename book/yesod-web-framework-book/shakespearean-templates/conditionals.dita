  <p id="x1">Eventually, you'll want to put in some logic in your page. The goal of Hamlet is to
            make the logic as minimalistic as possible, pushing the heavy lifting into Haskell. As
            such, our logical statements are very basic... so basic, that it's <codeph id="x-3">if</codeph>,
                <codeph id="x-4">elseif</codeph>, and
            <codeph id="x-5">else</codeph>.<codeblock outputclass="hamlet" id="x2">$if isAdmin

            the same rules of normal interpolation apply to the content of the conditionals.</p>
