        <p id="x-3">Hamlet is the most sophisticated of the languages. Not only does is provide syntax for
            generating HTML, it also allows for basic control structures: conditionals, looping, and
            maybes. While in general Shakespearean templates tend to be logic-less, some control is
            given within HTML for practical purposes.</p>
