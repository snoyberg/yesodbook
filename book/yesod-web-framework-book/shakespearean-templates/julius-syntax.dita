  <p id="x1">Julius is the simplest of the languages discussed here. In fact, some might even say
   it's really just Javascript. Julius allows the three forms of interpolation we've mentioned so
   far, and otherwise applies no transformations to your content.<note id="x2">If you use Julius
    with the scaffolded Yesod site, you may notice that your Javascript is automatically minified.
    This is not a feature of Julius; instead, Yesod uses the <apiname id="x3">hjsmin</apiname>
    package to minify Julius output.</note></p>
