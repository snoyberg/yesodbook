  <p id="x1">Similarly, we have a special construct for dealing with Maybe values. This could
   technically be dealt with using <codeph id="x-3">if</codeph>, <codeph id="x-4">isJust</codeph> and
    <codeph id="x-5">fromJust</codeph>, but this is more convenient and avoids partial
   functions.<codeblock outputclass="hamlet" id="x2">$maybe name &lt;- maybeName
    &lt;p&gt;Your name is #{name}
$nothing
    &lt;p&gt;I don't know your name.</codeblock>In
   addition to simple identifiers, you can use a few other, more complicated values on the left hand
   side, such as constructors and tuples.</p>
  <codeblock id="x-6" outputclass="hamlet">$maybe Person firstName lastName &lt;- maybePerson
    &lt;p&gt;Your name is #{firstName} #{lastName}</codeblock>
  <p id="x-7">The right-hand-side follows the same rules as interpolations, allow variables, function
   application, and so on.</p>
