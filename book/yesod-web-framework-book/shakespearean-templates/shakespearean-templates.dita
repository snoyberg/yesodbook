  <p id="x1">Yesod uses the Shakespearean family of template languages as its standard approach to HTML, CSS
   and Javascript creation. This language family shares some common syntax, as well as overarching
    principles:<ul id="ul_49ef34dd-2fd1-41b2-9c21-eb1bf09ac57a">
    <li id="x2">As little interference to the underlying language as possible, while providing
     conveniences where unobtrusive.</li>
    <li id="x3">Compile-time guarantees on well-formed content.</li>
    <li id="x4">Strict type safety, extending to the prevention of <xref
      href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting" format="html" scope="external">XSS
      (cross-site scripting)</xref> attacks.</li>
    <li id="x5">Automated checking of valid URLs, whenever possible, through <term id="x6">type-safe
     URLs</term>.</li>
   </ul></p>
  <p id="x7">There is nothing inherently tying Yesod to these languages, or the other way around:
   each can be used independently of the other. This chapter will address these template languages
   on their own, while the remainder of the book will use them to enhance Yesod application
   development.</p>
