        <p>There are four main languages at play: Hamlet is an HTML templating language, Julius is
            for Javascript, and Cassius and Lucius are both for CSS. Hamlet and Cassius are both
            whitespace-sensitive formats, using indentation to denote nesting. By contrast, Lucius
            is a superset of CSS, keeping CSS's braces for denoting nesting. Julius is a simple
            passthrough language for producing Javascript; the only added feature is variable
            interpolation.</p>
