            sources here as well. Since the purpose of these values are for reading (not writing),
            we use <codeph id="x1">ByteString</codeph>s in place of <codeph id="x2"
            >Builder</codeph>s. There is a record inside <codeph>Request</codeph> called
                <codeph>requestBody</codeph>, with type <codeph>BufferedSource IO
                ByteString</codeph>. We can use all of the standard conduit functions to interact
            with this source.</p><p id="reqbod3">The request body could in theory contain any type of data, but the most common are URL encoded and multipart form data. The <apiname id="x8">wai-extra</apiname> package contains built-in support for parsing these in a memory-efficient manner.</p></conbody></concept>
