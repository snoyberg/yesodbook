<concept id="widgets"><title id="x-1">Widgets</title><conbody id="x-2"><p id="i1">One of the challenges in web development is that we have to coordinate three different client-side technologies: HTML, CSS and Javascript. Worse still, we have to place these components in different locations on the page: CSS in a style tag in the head, Javascript in a script tag in the head, and HTML in the body. And never mind if you want to put your CSS and Javascript in separate files!</p><p id="i2">In practice, this works out fairly nicely when building a single page, because we can
            separate our structure (HTML), style (CSS) and logic (Javascript). But when we want to
            build modular pieces of code that can be easily composed, it can be a headache to
            coordinate all three pieces separately. Widgets are Yesod's solution to the problem.
            They also help with the issue of including libraries, such as jQuery, one time only.</p><p id="i3">Our four template languages- Hamlet, Cassius, Lucius and Julius- provide the raw tools for constructing your output. Widgets provide the glue that allows them to work together seamlessly.</p></conbody></concept>
