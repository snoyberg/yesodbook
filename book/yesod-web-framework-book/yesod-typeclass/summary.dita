            application. Besides <codeph>approot</codeph>, they are all optional, and provide
            sensible defaults. By using built-in Yesod constructs like
                <codeph>defaultLayout</codeph> and <codeph>getMessage</codeph>, you'll get a
            consistent look-and-feel throughout your site, including pages automatically generated
            by Yesod such as error pages and authentication.</p><p id="s2">We haven't covered all the methods in the Yesod typeclass in this chapter. For a full
            listing of methods available, you should consult the Haddock documentation.</p></conbody></concept>
