<concept id="introduction-to-haskell"><title id="x-1">Introduction to Haskell</title><conbody id="x-2"><p id="intro1">Haskell is a powerful, fast, type-safe, functional programming language. This book takes as an assumption that you are already familiar with most of the basics of Haskell. There are two wonderful books for learning Haskell, both of which are available for reading online:</p><ul id="x1"><li id="x2"><xref id="x3" href="http://learnyouahaskell.com" scope="external" format="html">Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!</xref></li><li id="x4"><xref id="x5" href="http://book.realworldhaskell.org/read" scope="external" format="html">Real World Haskell</xref></li></ul><p id="intro2">Yesod relies on a few features in Haskell that most introductory tutorials do not cover. Though you will rarely need to understand how these work, it's always best to start off with a good appreciation for what your tools are doing. There will be an appendix added later covering some of these topics.</p></conbody></concept>
