<concept id="routing-and-handlers"><title>Routing and Handlers</title><conbody><p id="intro1">If we look at Yesod as a Model-View-Controller framework, routing and handlers make up the controller. For contrast, let's describe two other routing approaches used in other web development environments:</p><ul id="x1"><li id="x2">Dispatch based on file name. This is how PHP and ASP work, for example.</li><li id="x3">Have a centralized routing function that parses routes based on regular expressions. Django and Rails follow this approach.</li></ul><p id="intro2">Yesod is closer in principle to the latter technique. Even so, there are significant differences. Instead of using regular expressions, Yesod matches on pieces of a route. Instead of having a one-way route-to-handler mapping, Yesod has an intermediate data type (called the route datatype, or a type-safe URL) and creates two-way conversion functions.</p><p id="intro3">Coding this more advanced system manually is tedious and error prone. Therefore, Yesod relies heavily on Template Haskell and Quasi-Quotation to automatically generate this code for you. This chapter will explain the syntax of the routing declarations, give you a glimpse of what code is generated for you, and explain the interaction between routing and handler functions.</p></conbody></concept>
